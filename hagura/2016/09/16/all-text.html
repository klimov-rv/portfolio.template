Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.” That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. “Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.</p><p>I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am.</p><p>We believe that we can change the things around us in accordance with our desires—we believe it because otherwise we can see no favourable outcome. We do not think of the outcome which generally comes to pass and is also favourable: we do not succeed in changing things in accordance with our desires, but gradually our desires change. The situation that we hoped to change because it was intolerable becomes unimportant to us. We have failed to surmount the obstacle, as we were absolutely determined to do, but life has taken us round it, led us beyond it, and then if we turn round to gaze into the distance of the past, we can barely see it, so imperceptible has it become.</p><p>The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart.</p><p>Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It’s hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It’s round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you’ve got a hundred years here. There’s only one rule that I know of, babies-“God damn it, you’ve got to be kind.</p><hr class="divider"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '../../../../../webjeda-demo.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })();</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the comments</noscript> </article></main><footer><div class="links"> <a href="../../../about/index.html">About</a> <a href="../../../contact/index.html">Contact</a> <a class="theme" onclick="theme()">Dark/Light</a></div><p class="copy"><small>Copyrights by Hagura - Light! | Developed by <a href="../../../../index.html">webjeda</a></small></p></footer><script src="../../../../../cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ga-lite%401/dist/ga-lite.min.js" async></script><script> var galite = galite || {}; galite.UA = 'UA-83979019-1';</script></body>
